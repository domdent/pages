            Back in my final year for my master's degree, I was handed a deceptively simple challenge: <em>"Make sense of high-dimensional data by staring at 2-D pictures of it."</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            The classic trick for that is the <strong>Grand Tour</strong> - an algorithm that rotates an <em>n</em>-D dataset so quickly that a 2-D screen feels like a window into higher dimensions (imagine animating a cube until the 3-D shape pops out). Fun, but painfully slow. I wanted something faster and smarter.
          </p>

          <p>
            That curiosity dragged me down a rabbit-hole of geometry called the <strong>Stiefel manifold</strong>. Think of it as the space of all possible "camera angles" you can point at an <em>n</em>-D dataset, more formally they are matrices that represent orthonormal frames that you can use to transform the data. Instead of blindly spinning the cube, I could <em>optimise</em> over those angles and jump straight to the most informative view.
          </p>

          <h2>First brush with machine learning</h2>
          <p>
            To judge which view was "informative," I used a linear <strong>Support Vector Machine</strong> hinge-loss as my cost function. That one decisionâ€”bolting a tiny ML model onto a physics-style optimisation problemâ€”was my gateway drug to machine learning.
            Debugging gradients felt exactly like checking Lagrangians in mechanics, just with Python instead of pen-and-paper.
          </p>

          <h2>Four algorithms went into the ring</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Vanilla gradient descent</strong> â€“ nice and deterministic, but loves local minima.</li>
            <li><strong>Stochastic gradient descent</strong> â€“ same idea, plus a random kick to escape ruts.</li>
            <li><strong>Particle-swarm optimisation</strong> â€“ a flock of candidate projections chasing the best performer.</li>
            <li><strong>Genetic algorithm on the Stiefel manifold</strong> â€“ crossover via geodesics, mutations via random tangent kicks.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            That genetic approach was the real breakthrough: blending two parent projections along the manifold's "straightest path" meant every child <em>already</em> satisfied the orthogonality constraints. It felt less like numerical hacking and more like sculpting in curved space.
          </p>

          <h2>Why it still feels like physics</h2>
          <p>
            The maths is pure differential geometryâ€”geodesics, Cayley transforms, even the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury trick for fast matrix inverses. Swapping "phase space" for "manifold of frames" kept the project firmly in my physics comfort zone while delivering ML-style results.
          </p>

          <h2>Results in two bullet points</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Wine dataset (13 features, 3 classes)</strong> â€“ found a 2-D projection with 100% linear separability in seconds.</li>
            <li><strong>Breast-cancer dataset (30 features, 2 classes)</strong> â€“ 98.2% accuracy on unseen data, matching the full 30-D SVM while throwing away 28 dimensions.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Take-aways for the tech folks</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Geometry matters.</strong> Sometimes the best optimisation landscape isn't Euclidean.</li>
            <li><strong>Physics intuition transfers.</strong> If you've ever minimised an action, you already grok gradient descent on a manifold.</li>
            <li><strong>Creativity lives in constraints.</strong> By respecting the Stiefel manifold's rules, the genetic algorithm turned a clunky search into an elegant dance.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            I walked into this project thinking "data visualisation." I walked out hooked on machine learning, armed with a toolbox of manifold tricks, and convinced that the border between physics and ML is mostly paperwork.
